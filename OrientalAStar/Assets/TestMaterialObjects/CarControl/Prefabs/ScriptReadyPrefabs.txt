These are cars that have their fundamentals set up for you. (Pivot, scale, etc.).
They are yours to attach your own script to, or, if you're
a real beginner, I've provided a free car script and prefabs of the cars i made
myself that's mobile compatible.
There is also a car control rig you can drag into your scene if you want to make 
your game for mobile.
It's not as good as some free scripts out there,but it's pretty good.(what do you expect from a 13 year old :P)
if you know how to, you can edit the coding to your liking. You
can contact me if you found out a way to make the code better!
Also, please contact me to report any bugs, or just some suggestions.
Your critisism can help make me a better developer!
